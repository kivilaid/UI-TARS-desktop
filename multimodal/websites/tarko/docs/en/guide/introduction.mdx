# Introduction

**Tarko** *(Tool-augmented Agent Runtime Kernel, Open-source)*, pronounced **`/ˈtɑːrkoʊ/`**, is a tool-call and event-stream driven Agent runtime framework with powerful **Context Engineering** capabilities.

## What is Tarko?

Tarko provides:

- **Context Engineering**: Build agents capable of long-running operations
- **Tool Call Engine**: Support for multiple LLM providers with custom parsers
- **Event Stream Processing**: Native streaming and Agent Protocol support
- **Agent Hooks**: Powerful extension capabilities
- **Agent Protocol**: Standard format definitions for agent lifecycle

## Key Features

### 🔧 Tool Call Engine
Support for multiple Tool Call engines including native Function Call, custom parsers, and models that don't support native Function Tool.

### 🌊 Event Stream
Built-in event stream processing with native streaming support and standardized Agent Protocol.

### 🧠 Context Engineering
Advanced context management for long-running agent operations with automatic context optimization.

### 🔌 Agent Hooks
Extensible hook system for customizing agent behavior at every stage of execution.

## Architecture Overview

Tarko is built with a three-layer architecture:

1. **Engineering Layer**: CLI, Server, and UI components
2. **Application Layer**: Tarko-based Agent implementations
3. **Kernel Layer**: Core runtime with Context Engineering and Agent Protocol

## Who Uses Tarko?

Tarko powers several production systems:

- **[UI-TARS-2](https://seed-tars.com/showcase/ui-tars-2/)**: Advanced UI automation
- **[UI-TARS-desktop](https://github.com/bytedance/UI-TARS-desktop)**: Desktop automation
- **[Agent TARS](https://agent-tars.com/)**: General-purpose multimodal agent
